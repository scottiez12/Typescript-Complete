    Type = easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has
        -- "interface" and "type" are more or less the same thing

13.
    object types and primitive types are important because you can do different things with the different categories

14/15. => refer to types.ts

16.
    Type annotations and inference
    -- annotations => code we add to tell typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
    -- inference => typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

17.
    Annotations with variables =>  variables.ts

20.
    inference
        const color = 'red'; =>  so 'const color' is the variable declaration, and the value on the right is the variable initialization
        so if the declaration and initialization are inline/on the same line, that's how TS infers the type for that variable
    --!!! so if the declaration and initialization are on the same line, we'll let TS user inference, 
            if we either A: declare a variable on one line then initialize it later, B: we want a variable to have a type that can't
                be inferred, or C: when a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value, we're going to write our own annotations

21.
    the 'any' type
        -- a type, just like a string or a boolean
        -- TS can't figure out what it is, so it cna't check for correct prop type references
        -- basically, avoid variables with 'any' at all costs

25.
    more on annotations concerning functions
        -- so TS tries to figure out what a function will return, but it doesn't do anything with the args to the function
        -- see functions.ts   

30.
    annotations on objects
        -- objects.ts

31.
    arrays with typescript  
        -- array.ts

35/37.
    tuples in TS
        -- array-like structure where each element represents some property of a record
        -- tuples.ts
        -- in general, we won't use these much... they're kind of relevant in edge cases, but not really all that useful

44.
    interfaces
        -- interfaces.ts
        -- general strategy => create functions that accept arguments that are typed with interfaces / objects/classes can decide to implement a given interfaces
            to work with a function (inheritance... basically.)

45.
    classes in TS   
        -- a blueprint to create an object with some fields (values) and methods (functions) to represent a "thing"/"object"
        -- the 'extends' keyword is how we do inheritance with TS (same as our 'class : inherits from' in C#)
        --  can override inherited methods (like in c#), though there is no 'override' keyword or anything like that
        -- we have access modifiers here too (public, private, protected)
            - public: this is the 'default' for classes, method can be called anywhere at any time where class is implemented
            - private: can only be called by other methods in this class
            - protected: can be called by other methods in this class, or by other methods in child classes
            -!!!!!!!! the access modifiers here go onto the FUNCTION/FIELDS (public honk():void{}), NOT the class itself
            -!!!!!!!! modifiers cannot be changed in child classes... so if a parent class method is public, a class that inherits from it  
                (even if it's overriding the method) can't change the method to private or protected
        -- access modifiers on functions don't have anything to do with application security; it's for cleanliness and safety for classes to call one another

49.
    classes with inheritance
        -- if a constructor is defined on the parent class, then the child class automatically calls that parent constructor
            however, if the child class defines a constructor too, you have to call the 'super();' inside the child consructor and provide
            any args you need to satisfy the parent constructor
        -- a lot of this is pretty similar to C#; curious to see how this all integrates together though, especially in funciton component React apps

63.
    on global imports && types
        -- any script tag that we add to the main index.html becomes a global variable, however it has to be referenced in the components we want to use it in
            ex. "/// <reference types="@types/google.maps" />" up with the import statements... then we get the 'google' object
        -- syntax for types is general, but not always, "npm install @types/packageName"
            -- 'definitely typed' is the name of the project that makes all these package type files open source
        -- 'model.d.ts' =>  model.definitions.typescript

74.
    'implements' keyword
        -- so to "implement" an interface on a class, use the implements keyword
            ex. "export class User implements Mappable{}" 
            => see User.ts and CustomMap.ts for code
        -- really the main reason to do this is to get TS to show you which file has the root error (isn't implementing whatever field), 
            instead of it just throwing an error on whatever component that object is used on.

78.
    concurrently/nodemon/tsconfig.json/package.json
        -- check out those files.. nodemon and concurrently are npm packages.

84.
    type-guards
        -- we can use this to tell typescript something of is of a certain type, when we're using a union operator for type declaration
            ex. "constructor(public collection: number[] | string) {}" then we can use this as a type guard  if(this.collection instanceof Array){}
        -- see notes/typeguard
        -- another ex of a typeguard for string  ----if(typeof this.collection === "string"){}
        --!!!! typeof = when you want to clarify if something is a primitive value  (boolean, number, string, and symbol)
            instanceof = when it's any other type of value (non-primitive); based on constructor of whatever we're trying to check
    
96.
    abstract classes in TS  
        -- so the problem is that when we use inheritance, the parent methods' constructor gets called in the child, but the parent method doesn't "know" if it
            is going to have all the necessary props... it will say "hey they dont exist on this (parent) class", even though WE know that any time we're extending that class,
            we're going to have all the necessary props.. we solve this by assigning the classes as abstract
        -- abstract classes in ts all...
            - can't be used to create an object directly
            - only used as a parent class
            - can contain real implementation for some methods
            - the implemented methods can refer to other methods that don't actually exist yet ( we still have to provide names and types for
                the un-implemented methods... basically as placeholders)
            - can make child classes promise to implement some other method (similar to how we use interfaces in C#)
        -- examples in /atts/sort/src/...

99.
    interfaces vs abstract classes
        -- interfaces:
            - sets up a contract between different classes
            - use when we have very different objects that we want to work together
            - promotes loose coupling
        -- abstract classes (inheritance):
            - sets up a contract between different classes
            - use when we're trying to build up a definition of an object
            - strongly couples classes together
        -- basically, try to use interfaces first, them inheritance next

107/108.
    enums in TS
        -- ex
            enum MatchResult {
                            HomeWin = "H",
                            AwayWin = "A",
                            Draw = "D",
                            }
        -- when to use/in general   
            - near identical syntax to normal objects
            - creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to json
            - primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely related values
            - use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
            - enums can be declared without values... ex Homewin, AwayWin, Draw,.... then we can assign the values later

113.
    type assertions
        -- basically overriding TS on the type of a given value 
        --  ex. row[5] as MatchResult, where row[5] is a string value and MatchResult is an enum
        -- /apps/stats/csvfilereader.ts

118.
    generics in ts  
        -- like function arguments, but for types in class/function definitions
        -- allows us to define the type of a property/argument/return value at a future point
        -- used heavily when writing resuable code.
        -- files in the "inheritance" folder

125. 
    inheritance vs composition
        -- inheritance is using abstract classes, composition is using the interface/separate classes
        -- inheritance => characterized by an "IS A" relationship between two classes
            -- ex. matchReader IS A csvfilereader // wall(child) IS A rectangle(parent)
        -- composition => characterized by an "HAS A" relationship between two classes
            -- ex. matchReader HAS A reference to an outside object (csvfilereader)
        
134.
    static methods in TS
        -- methods that can be called off the class itself...not an instance of a class
            -- the info the needs to be defined in the class... all the args and logic. 

137-140.
    Advanced/more on generics

        -- adding constraints... import. see in above file.

264.
    really interesting topics here regarding state in react wiht TS

265.
    return type of functional components (most of the time) is ":JSX.Element"... interesting. Never saw that before.
